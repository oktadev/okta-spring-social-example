## Getting Started

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`. Then, run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **Web** and press **Enter**.

Select **Other**. Then, change the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback` and use `http://localhost:8080` for the Logout Redirect URI.

Copy `src/main/resources/application.template.yml` to `src/main/resources/application.yml` and fill in the necessary information.

See [these instructions](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/24/social-spring-boot#configure-google-and-facebook-for-social-login-in-your-spring-boot-app) to complete your social login setup.
